        <p>Consider hiding the status bar-and all other app UI
            -while people are actively viewing full-screen media. 
            If you hide the status bar, be sure to let people retrieve it
            (and the appropriate app UI) with a single tap.
            Unless you have a compelling reason to do so, avoid custom
            gesture to redisplay the status bar because users are unlikely
            to discover such a gesture or to remember it.
